LeetCode to Todoist stores the Todoist REST API token you provide in Chrome sync storage on your own devices. The token is used only to authenticate Todoist API calls when you press ‘Add to Todoist’. No other personal data is collected, stored, or shared. The extension reads the title and URL of the LeetCode problem currently open in your browser solely to create the Todoist task. Nothing is transmitted to any service other than Todoist.
